# Tennis-Tracker-Hub

<!-- redeploy trigger: 2026-07-06, working around a stuck GitHub Pages deployment queue -->

## Project Overview
Monorepo combining the Garmin tennis tracker app (MatchMind) and the Training Hub web dashboard, connected via Supabase. The goal is to keep developing both apps independently while integrating them through Supabase: the Garmin app records match data on-watch and syncs it to Supabase; the Training Hub web app reads that data and displays tennis stats alongside all other training data.

## Apps

### Training Hub (`apps/training-hub/`)
- Single-file HTML/JS/CSS web app (~7000+ lines in `index.html`)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages
- Multi-sport training dashboard: Gym · Climbing · Rehab · Planner · Tennis
- **Tennis tab LIVE (2026-06-12):** end-to-end pipeline verified — watch records match → syncs to Supabase `matches` → Tennis tab displays history, win rate, recent form, per-match stats
- Main file: `index.html`
- Live at: https://fpv64ncs5p-maker.github.io/Tennis-Tracker-Hub/

### Garmin Tennis Tracker (`apps/garmin/`)
- Monkey C app for Garmin watches (tested on Vivoactive 6)
- Branded as **MatchMind** (app files named TennisTracker)
- Tracks live tennis matches on-watch, syncs to Supabase after each match
- Key files: `source/TennisMatchEngine.mc`, `source/SupabaseSync.mc`
- Store: https://apps.garmin.com/apps/a4302e08-340f-4a11-8970-1cb44e7ab34f

## Tech Stack
- **Garmin app:** Monkey C (ConnectIQ SDK 9.1.0, API 6.0)
- **Web app:** HTML, JavaScript, CSS (single file, no build step, no external CDN)
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase — Training Hub project (`pmzzmvzbgeonjnbfreze`), `matches` table
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (web), ConnectIQ Store (Garmin)
- **Version control:** GitHub (private repo)

## Key Principles
- Always ask before making structural changes
- Keep this CLAUDE.md updated with important decisions
- Garmin app and web app are deployed independently
- Supabase is the bridge between both apps — Garmin writes, Training Hub reads
- Training Hub is mobile-first (700px max width), offline-first, light mode only
- MatchMind MVP principle: "I can play a full set and log every point without frustration"

## Security
- `Secrets.mc` is excluded from git (listed in `.gitignore`) — contains API keys and credentials for the Garmin app
- The GitHub repo is private
- Supabase RLS: anon INSERT (watch app) + anon SELECT (web app) + anon DELETE (web "Delete permanently"). The anon key is public — accepted trade-off for a personal tracker (`db/2026-06-16_anon_delete_matches.sql`)

## Current Version
- Garmin app: **v1.4.9** (approved + real-watch tested 2026-06-15 — tap-scoring fix confirmed working). v1.5.0 (serve/return points-played) submitted 2026-06-15, awaiting approval. v1.4.8 approved + real-watch tested 2026-06-15: Undo button works, but surfaced a tap-scoring bug (ERROR taps near the top of the button often registered as YOU/WON). v1.4.7 approved + real-watch verified 2026-06-12: sync works, rows arrive in `matches`.
- v1.4.9 (tap-scoring fix — Option 2 "buffer + bigger buttons"; `MainView.mc` only): ERROR/D.FAULT sat in a thin strip directly under the huge "tap top half = YOU won" zone with NO gap, so an ERROR tap landing a few px high silently scored for the player — made worse by v1.4.8's UNDO bar eating the bottom of the scoring band. Fix: a NEUTRAL DEAD-ZONE between WON and the buttons — a tap in `[deadZoneTopY 58%, buttonTopY 63%)` does nothing (grey blink). Buttons enlarged (now `63%→87%`, was `66%→86%`), score block nudged up (oval bottom now 58%, clears the buffer), UNDO slimmed to a 32%-wide bar. Tap zones top→bottom: WON `y<58%` · DEAD `58–63%` · ERROR/D.FAULT `63–87%` (split at centre x) · UNDO `y>87%`. iCloud build source edited; `apps/garmin/source/` mirror synced.
- v1.4.8 (4 fixes from first real-watch evening with working sync):
  1. **Supabase retry QUEUE** (5 slots, `supabase_q_0..4`, legacy key migrated) — single slot meant a failed upload was OVERWRITTEN by the next match (one match permanently lost 2026-06-12). Queue drains by chaining: each successful `onResponse` triggers `retryNextPending()`.
  2. **MatchMenu tap-twice confirm** — first tap highlights, second tap executes (RESUME pre-highlighted, so single-tap resume still works). Fixes mid-match SAVE/LATER/DISCARD mis-hits.
  3. **LATER stops + saves the recording** (`stopSessionForLater`, no sync) — previously left the session running, watch OS showed its own save dialog, matches "saved" there bypassed sync + history. One interrupted match = two Garmin activities (Jo's choice over losing HR data).
  4. **Dedicated UNDO button** (replaces MatchMind branding strip below ERROR/D.FAULT) — swipe-up undo registers as a top-half TAP on the real watch, ADDING a point instead of undoing. Swipe-up still works as fallback.
- v1.4.6: approved + installed on watch 2026-06-12. Real-watch test: activity saves to Garmin Connect but NO request reaches Supabase (confirmed via API Gateway logs). curl test with same key/payload → 201, so Supabase side is fully working; failure is on-watch and silent.
- v1.4.1: bigger fonts in MatchMenu and MatchHistory
- v1.4.2: readability improvements across Setup, MainView, MatchMenu, MatchHistory
- v1.4.3: fix Supabase sync — correct anon key in Secrets.mc; Supabase ALTER TABLE added DEFAULT 0 to stat columns, dropped NOT NULL from hr_avg/hr_max/player_served_first
- v1.4.4: remove set_scores array-of-dicts from payload — CIQ JSON serializer silently failed on nested arrays, preventing makeWebRequest from firing at all
- v1.4.5: remove hr_avg/hr_max null values + convert playerServing Boolean to 1/0 — CIQ JSON serializer silently fails on null and Boolean types
- v1.4.6: rebuild + resubmit of the v1.4.5 payload fixes. NOTE (2026-06-12 correction): the versionCode theory was wrong — the sed edit landed in the monorepo manifest (never built), the submitted .iq had NO versionCode, and the store update still reached the watch fine. versionCode is not part of the CIQ manifest schema and is irrelevant. See `MatchMind_Supabase_Sync_Findings.md`
- v1.4.7: **ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED** — `"Content-Type" => "application/json"` (string) fails CIQ's local header validation with -200 (INVALID_HTTP_HEADER_FIELDS_IN_REQUEST); the request NEVER left the watch, on simulator and real device alike, in every version since sync was built. Fix: `"Content-Type" => Comm.REQUEST_CONTENT_TYPE_JSON` (enum constant). Verified in simulator: SYNC OK + rows inserted in `matches` (incl. retried stuck payload). Also in v1.4.7: visible sync status (new `SyncStatus.mc`) in PostMatchView + SetupView — `SYNC ...` / `SYNC SENT` / `SYNC OK` (green) / `SYNC ERR n` (red) / `SYNC EXC`; and Prefer header → `return=representation` (empty 201 body from `return=minimal` triggers CIQ -400 with JSON responseType, disguising success as failure)

## Deployment

### Training Hub (web app)
- Edit `index.html` in `apps/training-hub/`
- Copy changes to root: `cp apps/training-hub/index.html .` (the root file is what GitHub Pages serves)
- **Deploy via GitHub Desktop** (replaces the old `curl`/GitHub-API push): open GitHub Desktop → review the diff → type a summary → **Commit to main** → **Push origin**. GitHub Pages auto-deploys in ~1 min. Desktop handles auth, so no token needed.
- GitHub Desktop and Claude both work in the **same** folder (`~/Documents/Tennis-Tracker-Hub`) — single source of truth, no duplicate clones.
- Day-to-day cheat-sheet: see `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` (repo root).
- Live at: https://fpv64ncs5p-maker.github.io/Tennis-Tracker-Hub/

### Garmin App
- ⚠️ **The build source of truth is the iCloud folder** (`PROJ007_Garmin App/Tennistracker/`) — `package.sh`/`run.sh` build THERE. `apps/garmin/` in this repo is a mirror for version control. Always edit the iCloud copy (or edit both), then keep them in sync — on 2026-06-12 a fix applied only to the mirror never made it into the built `.iq`.
- Source code in `apps/garmin/source/`
- `Secrets.mc` is NOT in git (excluded via .gitignore) — kept locally only
- Build for simulator: `./run.sh` (from iCloud project folder)
- Build for store:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/01\ Claude\ in\ Docs/02\ Projects/PROJ007_Garmin\ App/Tennistracker
  ./package.sh
  ```
  → generates `bin/Tennistracker.iq`
- Submit `.iq` file to: https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/
- Garmin approval takes ~2 hours
- Users install update from ConnectIQ Store

## Supabase Integration
- Project ID: `pmzzmvzbgeonjnbfreze`
- Table: `matches` (29 columns: all engine stats incl. serve/return points played+won, + nullable opponent_name, location, notes)
- RLS: anon INSERT (watch) + anon SELECT (web) + anon DELETE (web permanent-delete, `db/2026-06-16_anon_delete_matches.sql`)
- Watch app credentials in `Secrets.mc` (gitignored)

## Training Hub — Key Context
- **Architecture:** single-file, localStorage-first, no build step
- **Sync:** Supabase `user_data` table (migrated from GitHub Gist 2026-05-27 — DNS issue no longer present, Supabase confirmed working on mobile)
- **Tennis integration:** Tennis tab reads `matches` from Supabase (REST + anon key) and merges them with manually-logged matches (`tennis_matches` in localStorage).
- **Watch-match editing (overlay):** watch rows are not editable in the DB (no anon UPDATE). Web-side enrichment — Competition/Training category, partner, opponent, location, notes — and "remove from tab" (soft-hide, reversible) live in a `tennis_overlay` localStorage object keyed by match id, synced across devices via `user_data`. Two removal modes: "remove from tab" = reversible soft-hide (overlay only, no DB change); "Delete permanently" removes the row via an anon DELETE policy (`db/2026-06-16_anon_delete_matches.sql`). Doubles get a 2nd opponent field (Partner + Opponent 2 shown only for doubles). (Live + confirmed by Jo 2026-06-15.)
- **Serve/return %:** needs `service_points_played` + `return_points_played` columns (`db/2026-06-15_add_serve_return_played.sql`) + MatchMind **v1.5.0** to send them (engine already counts them; web already reads them, NULL-tolerant). v1.4.9 approved 2026-06-15; v1.5.0 submitted 2026-06-15, awaiting approval. **SQL columns added 2026-06-15 (confirmed by Jo, before submission)** — once v1.5.0 is approved + installed, serve/return won-lost + win% populate for new matches.
- **Competition/Training filter (2026-06-23):** Tennis tab has a second segment row (`#tennis-cat-filter`: All · Competition · Training) below the History/Stats toggle. `_tennisCatFilter` + `tennisCatFilter()` filter the single `matches` list in `renderTennis` via `catOk`, so summary cards, recent-form dots, Stats panel AND History list all recalculate for the chosen category — Competition and Training stats never mix. Uncategorised matches (no `category`) only appear under "All".
- **Activity colours:** Tennis = `#a78bfa` (lavender)
- **Tabs:** Home · Gym · Climbing · Rehab · Planner · (Tennis — to be added/integrated)
- **Climb draft recovery hardened (2026-06-22):** Jo lost an in-progress bouldering session when the phone screen turned off. Root cause: the climb draft autosave only fired *after* a climb was logged and `_restoreDraftClimb` discarded any draft with zero logged climbs — so a "session" that was just gym + meters was never saved. Fixes (Climbing tab, `index.html`): (1) `_saveDraftClimb` now saves on any started session — gym/date/duration/custom-wall changes too, not just logged climbs — and skips while editing a saved session (`_editingClimbId`); stores `customWall`. (2) New `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` listeners save the draft when the app is backgrounded / screen sleeps (iOS-reliable). (3) `_restoreDraftClimb` offers the Resume banner for any in-progress session, not only when climbs are logged. `restoreClimbDraft` restores custom wall height + reveals the field.
- **Add-your-own-gym + multi-wall (2026-06-22):** gym dropdown is rendered from `GYMS` (base) + a new persisted `custom_gyms` key (in `DATA_KEYS`, so it cloud-syncs). "➕ Add new gym…" opens `#modal-add-gym` (name + "has bouldering" checkbox + comma-separated rope-wall heights → `saveNewGym`). A gym value is EITHER a plain number (legacy/base form) OR `{walls:[14,18],boulder:true}`; accessors `gymWalls`/`gymHasBoulder`/`gymPrimaryHeight`/`gymLabel` normalise both. `getWallHeight`→`gymPrimaryHeight`. Each routes/Boulder block's wall-height picker is built by `gymWallOptions(b.wallHeight)` from the selected gym's walls (changing the gym re-renders blocks). Base `GYMS` stays numeric — several history meter calcs do `GYMS[s.gym]||s.wallHeight||0`; custom gyms fall back to the per-session `wallHeight` saved at log time.
- **Boulder vs Routes surfaced (2026-06-22):** dedicated "🪨 Boulder" block button next to "🧗 Routes" (creates a routes block preset to `climbingType='Boulder'`); routes-block header shows Boulder vs Routes. The Lead/Top-Rope/Boulder dropdown was previously buried inside a block.
- **Inline "Add another block" (2026-06-22):** the Routes/Boulder/Board/ARC add-block buttons now also render inline *between the blocks and Cool-down* (built in `renderClimbBlocks`), so adding the next burn needs no scrolling. The static bottom row (`#add-block-row`) is hidden once a session has content (`hasData`) and only shows to start the first block. Each block = one burn; block count + routes-per-block are intentionally meaningful. Remove via the block's ✕ (`removeClimbBlock`).
- **History sorted by date (2026-06-22):** Climbing, Gym, and Climbing Gym (FB) history lists now sort by session `date` descending (tie-break: most recently added `id`), so back-dated entries land in the right spot instead of at the top (`renderClimbHistory`/`renderGymHistory`/`renderFBHistory`). Gym already sorted; its sort + the others made null-date-safe.
- **Climb Started/Finished times (2026-06-22):** replaced the manual "Duration (min)" field with **Started** + **Finished** time inputs (`climb-start`/`climb-end`, `autoColonTime` + `updateClimbDuration`), mirroring the Gym tab. Total is auto-computed and shown in `#climb-duration-display`. Saved sessions now store `startTime`/`endTime` and the computed minutes in the existing `duration` field (so history, Week Totals, and Home — which read `duration` — keep working). Draft autosave stores `start`/`end`; `editClimbSession` repopulates the times.
- **Core exercise library expanded (2026-07-02):** added 13 exercises from `Training charts.xlsx` ("Core training Exerc" sheet) to the Gym module's `Core` category in `EXERCISES` — Feet-up Crunches, Mountain Climber Plank, One-Arm Elbow & Side Plank, Sling Trainer "Marine Core", Windshield Wipers, Superman, Reverse Plank, Reverse Mountain Climber Plank, Side Hip Raises, Dumbbell Snatch, Sumo Deadlift (DB/KB), Barbell Deadlift, Barbell Squat. Skipped the chart's "Climbing specific core" rows (Roof Lever-ups, Steep Wall Cut & Catch, Steep Wall Traversing, Front Lever) — already exist under `CG-Core`. Skipped "Hanging knee lifts" — near-duplicate of existing "Hanging Knees". Compound lifts (snatch/deadlift/squat) kept in `Core` per Jo's choice rather than a separate category. Sets/reps/rest are estimated defaults (chart didn't specify per-exercise volume, except a Barbell Deadlift %1RM protocol) — Jo may want to tune these. Edited in both `index.html` (root) and `apps/training-hub/index.html` (kept in sync); deployed with the 2026-07-06 push.
- **Lattice Assessment rebuilt to match real protocol (2026-07-02):** the Climbing → Pyramid tab already had an empty "Lattice Assessment" section (`modal-assessment`, `climb_assessments` storage key, never used). Compared against Jo's actual Lattice Training PDFs (`My Lattice&Climbing training docs/Lattice Assess/`) and found it didn't match the real test protocol — rebuilt the modal + `saveAssessment()`/`renderAssessments()` (~line 1155, ~4640 in `index.html`). New fields: Height + Wingspan (→ auto Ape Index), Goal; **Finger Strength** (Two-Arm Max Hang — edge mm, fingerboard model, load ±kg, auto %BM score); **Power Endurance** (Strength Endurance 60% — load, time sec); **Pulling Strength** (2-Rep Max Pull-up — load ±kg, auto %BM score); **Hip Flexibility** (heel-to-heel cm, auto %height score); each of the 4 tests has a manual Priority selector (Low/Moderate/High, colour-coded badge — mirrors the coach's pink/yellow/green priority highlights in the PDF reports). Kept Recent Climbing Performance (Sport/Boulder OS+RP grades) in the form alongside the existing Pyramid grade tracking, per Jo's choice — the Lattice reports pair grades with test scores in one snapshot. Removed old mismatched fields (Side Split, One-Arm Hang + hang-detail text) since `climb_assessments` had zero saved records — no migration needed. **Historical data not yet logged:** Jo's PDFs contain real results from 14.08.23, 16.11.23, and a Mar 2024 coach report, but the scans are rotated/low-res with ambiguous OCR — numbers need Jo to confirm before entering, rather than risk mistranscription. Edited in both `index.html` and `apps/training-hub/index.html`; deployed 2026-07-02, first real entry logged and confirmed working by Jo same day.
- **Lattice Assessment: body composition fields + sign-display bug fix (2026-07-02):** added Body Fat (%), Skeletal Muscle (kg), Bone Mass (kg) to the assessment modal/save/render (smart-scale readings, shown in the entry's header line alongside body mass/height/ape index). Also fixed a display bug where a user-typed leading "+" on Finger Strength/Power Endurance/Pull-up load fields doubled up with the auto-added sign (e.g. "++2.5 kg") — new `_signed()` helper normalizes via `parseFloat` before re-adding the sign, so old saved entries render correctly too (no data migration needed, it's render-only).
- **Lattice Assessment moved into Self-Assess tab (2026-07-02):** per Jo's request, the whole "Lattice Assessment" card (practical tests) relocated from the Pyramid sub-tab to the top of the Self-Assess sub-tab, above the subjective 8-category wizard/summary — both assessment types (practical + subjective) now live in one place. `climbMode()` updated: `renderAssessments()` now fires on `mode==='selfassess'` instead of `'pyramid'`. `#assessment-list` DOM id unchanged, so no JS elsewhere needed updating.
- **Per-muscle body diagram (2026-07-06):** the Gym session body map (`drawBodyDiagram`) previously lit whole category zones — one Chest Press lit lats/traps too, and one Rehab calf exercise lit the entire leg. Now each exercise lights only the muscles it works: new `EX_MUSCLES` map (exercise name → muscle keys: pecs, delts, biceps, triceps, traps, lats, forearms, abs, obliques, lowerback, quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves), `MUSCLE_ZONE` (muscle → zone colour, unchanged palette), and `CAT_MUSCLES` (category → zone muscles — fallback for unmapped/custom exercises = old behaviour). `drawBodyDiagram` now takes the exercises array (still accepts a Set of cats for safety); both callers (volume summary + history detail) updated, `workedCats` removed. Keyed by exercise *name*, so old logged sessions work with no migration. Warm-up cardio + Stretching intentionally light nothing (as before). Muscle assignments are sensible defaults — Jo may want to tune some (e.g. "Hip Adductor" → quads shape as nearest proxy). "Fly Deltoid N2" confirmed by Jo as a reverse fly (2026-07-06) → delts+traps, same as Rear Deltoid N1. New exercise "Leg Press (Calf Raise)" added under Inferior Members (2026-07-06) → calves only — Jo uses the leg press both normally (quads+glutes) and toes-only for calf/Achilles work; previously only distinguishable via comments, which the muscle map can't read. (The Rehab "Leg Press (Calfs)" still exists for rehab-protocol logging.)
- **Gym template rename + duration auto-name (2026-07-06):** each saved template row now has a ✏️ button → `renameTemplate(id)` (reuses `showTextModal`, same modal as generated-plan naming; syncs via `DB.set('gym_templates')`). New templates saved from a session are auto-named "areas · duration" (e.g. "Inferior + Superior + Core · 1h 34min") using `s.durationMins`; date suffix kept as fallback for sessions without times. Existing templates keep their old names — renameable by hand. Edited in both `index.html` and `apps/training-hub/index.html`; committed + deployed 2026-07-06.
